# Style guide
Consistency is the key to maintaining a collaborative environment.

Following a style guide helps makes code easier for others to read and understand. 

## PEP8
Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP)

Go ahead and read the whole [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python and you'll be good :thumbsup:

But seriously, follow PEP8 and you won't have any issues. It's clear and concise on what you should and shouldn't do. If you're ever in doubt, check out the guide.

Use a PEP8 code linter to help. PyCharm comes with one pre-installed with handy suggestions on how to fix warnings.
