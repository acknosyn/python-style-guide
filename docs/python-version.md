# Python 2.x vs 3.x
## **TL;DR:** Use Python 3 unless you have a really good reason not to.

My advice is to use Python 3 for any new projects. There's no point refactoring a project that uses Python 2.

### The age old debateâ€”what Python version should I use?
> Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the *present and future* of the language.

Probably the most obvious change between the two versions is the print statement.  
- Python 2.x  
`print 'some string'`
- Python 3.x  
`print('some string')`

### Lambda
AWS Lambda now [supports Python 3.6](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/aws-lambda-supports-python-3-6/) as well as Python 2.

### For more information
The Python wiki has a page on [Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) which contains a more in-depth explanation on the subject.
